Cell 1:
Generates 2D samples using:

	-Pseudo-random numbers (np.random.rand)

	-Halton sequence

	-Sobol sequence
Then plots and saves a side-by-side visual comparison of the three sample distributions.

Cell 2:
Performs numerical integration using both MC and QMC methods.
Calculates estimated values and absolute errors for each sample size and prints a performance table.

Cell 3:
Plots convergence of absolute error from Cell 2.
Displays and saves a log-log plot comparing MC and QMC integration performance (Figure 1 in the report).

Cell 4:
Simulates European call option pricing using both Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods under the Black-Scholes model.
Stores pricing estimates and absolute errors for each sample size.

Cell 5:
Plots the convergence of absolute error in option pricing using the data from Cell 4.
Saves this figure as Figure 2 for the report.

Cell 6:
Prints a formatted results table for option pricing estimates and errors (MC vs. QMC), which is used in Table 2 of the report.


NOTES**********
Random seed is set via np.random.seed(42) for reproducibility.

All plots are saved using plt.savefig and labeled for insertion into the PDF report.

Output from Cells 2 and 6 was used to manually construct Table 1 and Table 2 in the final document.
